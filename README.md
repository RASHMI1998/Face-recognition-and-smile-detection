# Real_time_face_recognition_and_smile_detection


This allows you to recognize faces from a respository of faces collected and helps you in real time smile detection. It includes the
following modules:-


1. Extract Faces: It extracts the faces using a CNN named hog (histogram of oriented gradients) from a provided video and stores it in the 
                  'faces' directory (these are the faces that are to be recognised).
                  
                  
2. Annotate: Annotate allows you to assign names to the faces that were extracted in Extract Faces.


3. Face Recogntion and Smile Detection: It allows you real time face recognition and smile detection. After running the python code, the 
                  camera starts running and when you pause using the keyboard keys by pressing 'p' on the keyboard, the code detects the 
                  faces and allows smile detection. The smile detection is done using trained datasets namely, 
                  haarcascade_frontalface_default and haarcascade_smile.
